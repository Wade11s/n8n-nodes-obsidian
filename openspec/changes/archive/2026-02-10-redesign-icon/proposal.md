# Proposal: Redesign Obsidian Node Icon

## Why

The current Obsidian node icon uses an abstract design that doesn't clearly represent Obsidian's brand identity. The icon should be instantly recognizable as Obsidian-related by using an "O" letter in Obsidian's crystalline visual style.

## What Changes

- Replace current icon (abstract flowing shapes) with a crystalline "O" design
- Use 4-facet crystal geometry with Obsidian's purple color palette
- Maintain rounded square container for consistency with n8n node icons
- Create both light and dark mode variants

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `obsidian-brand-icon`: Visual identity for Obsidian node icon using crystalline "O" design that matches Obsidian's crystal/stone aesthetic

### Modified Capabilities

None - this is a pure visual update with no functional changes

## Impact

- **Icon files**: `nodes/Obsidian/obsidian.svg` and `nodes/Obsidian/obsidian.dark.svg`
- **Build output**: `dist/nodes/Obsidian/obsidian.svg` and `dist/nodes/Obsidian/obsidian.dark.svg`
- **No API or functional changes** - purely cosmetic update
